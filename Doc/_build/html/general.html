<h1>General concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#general-concepts" title="Permalink to this heading">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>TCAT has two objectives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offer quick assessment of feasibility of space missions (both in systems design and operations)</p></li>
<li><p>Enable trade-offs of architectures, technologies, etc. by providing rough estimates of cost and performance figures</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main concepts that are used by TCAT to fulfill its objectives are:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Use Case</dt><dd><p>A use case is a particular type of service that fulfills the needs of a client. The original purpose of TCAT was the
use case of active debris removal for large satellite constellations. Another use case that was implemented in TCAT
was the transfer of cargo to the Moon for institutional actors. The goal of TCAT is to consolidate a number of tools
and methods that are not specific to a use case, but can be used to analyse, optimize and trade-off multiple aspects
of any use case, given appropriate delta development. The code base linked to use cases is separate from the core of
TCAT.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scenario</dt><dd><p>A scenario is a particular configuration of a <strong>use case</strong> described by a number of parameters. These parameters are
usually linked to the overall architecture of the service, the design of the systems, the orbits, the operations.
A scenario for active debris removal could be for instance 3 servicers, with their design and insertion orbits
defined, each visiting 5 targets to perform orbit lowering with a visit to a tanker for refueling between each
target. The code base linked to scenarios is separate from the core of TCAT and linked to the code base of the use
case.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fleet</dt><dd><p>A fleet is a collection of <em>servicers</em> (satellites, launchers, ground segments, etc) that will be used to fulfill
a <strong>scenario</strong>. Within a fleet, servicers can be grouped together depending on their purpose and design.
For instance the  active debris removal fleet can consist of removers and tankers. The code base linked to the
definition, management and use of fleets is not dependant on the use case.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Servicer</dt><dd><p>A servicer is a collection of <em>modules</em> (propulsion, communication, data handling, cargo, etc) that is part of a
<strong>fleet</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Module</dt><dd><p>Each module that constitutes the <strong>servicer</strong> needs to be thought of as a functional block. The most important
modules for a servicer will generally be modules that deal with transport and propellant (launch, orbit change,
planetary insertions, etc). Each module has models for their power consumption and dry mass and possible
additional performance models (propulsion specific impulse, etc). These models can be different depending on the
servicer group. The code base linked to the definition, management and use of servicers is not dependant on the use
case. Each new use case might require the refinement of existing modules or the creation of additional modules.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Plan</dt><dd><p>A plan is a collection of <em>phases</em> that will be required to perform a <strong>scenario</strong> (launch, orbit changes,
rendezvous, servicing, etc) . A plan has a chronological order. The code base linked to the definition, management
and use of plans is not dependant on the use case.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Phase</dt><dd><p>A phase describes any type of operations performed during a <strong>plan</strong>. Each phase needs to be assigned to a
<strong>module</strong>. For instance, an orbit change needs to be assigned to a propulsion module of the servicer that will
perform the operation. The phase is defined in terms of its duration and its impact on the performing servicer
and on its environment. These impacts are usually either changes in orbits, consumption or production of resources
or servicing operations. For instance, a capture phase, performed by a capture module on a servicer needs to be
assigned a target (removal client) and will link the motion of the target with the servicer until a release phase
is called. Each new use case might require the refinement of existing phases or the creation of additional modules.</p>
